# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created as a place for students to take notes while going through the Prework for the bootcamp. This would then help them by providing a webpage where they can go and revisit key information from their Prework course. I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and how they all work together to produce the final Webpage.
